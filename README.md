# ruby-soccer-test
Ruby program for CSV data

This is a program that will read data about the English Premier League from a .csv file and will display the following results to the console:

- The team with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goals.
- A list of the top 10 teams with the highest win percentage.
- Full stats for the team with the most draws (include all columns available in CSV file)

To get started, simply clone the repo and make sure your environment has the following specs:
- Ruby 2 (Written using Ruby 2.2.3p147 but should work in any flavor of Ruby 2)

Once you have your environment setup, do the following:
- Open up terminal
- Navigate to the location you cloned the repo to
- type *ruby soccer-test.rb*
- Hit Enter

Results should be displayed to the screen with descriptions of each statistic.

Any questions can be directed to Ashley Wilson.
